# Word_Cloud_Assignment_OOP
Name print with a background image by python.

This repository demonstrates how to create a custom WordCloud using Python. The script reads text from a file, processes it, and generates a WordCloud in the shape of a specified mask image.

Features

Generates a WordCloud with up to 500 words. Customizable background color and colormap. Uses a mask image to shape the WordCloud. Outputs a visually appealing WordCloud.

How It Works

Input Text: The script reads text data from a file (text.csv). Mask Image: The shape of the WordCloud is based on a black-and-white mask image (Name.jpg). WordCloud Generation: The script processes the text and fills the mask shape with words. Visualization: The WordCloud is displayed using Matplotlib for viewing and saving.

Output

Below is an example of the generated WordCloud:
